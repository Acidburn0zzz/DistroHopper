DistroHopper
============

DistroHopper is a home screen replacement for Android that can resemble a number of different Linux desktops, including Ubuntu's Unity desktop, elementary OS's Pantheon desktop and the Gnome desktop.

## Where can I get it?

The latest stable build can be downloaded from [ubuntu.robinj.be](http://ubuntu.robinj.be/). The current stable build is a bit old, so it still uses the old branding (Ubuntu Launcher) and contains a bit less features.

## How can I help?

If you speak a non-English language, and your knowledge of the English language is sufficient, then you can help out by translating the project into your language. This can be done [on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/distrohopper/).
If you want to help out and translate the project into a language that isn't listed yet, contact me at android-dev@robinj.be so I can add that language to the project.
