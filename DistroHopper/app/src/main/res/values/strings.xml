    <string name="option_launcher_running_show">Show running apps</string>
    <string name="hint_launcher_running_show">The Launcher will show which apps are currently running. This will be indicated by a small arrow on the left side of the icon. Apps which are running but have not been pinned to the Launcher will also be shown.\nNOTE: This feature no longer works reliably from Android 5.0 onwards because of restrictions that were added to the operating system.</string>

    <string name="option_colourcalc_hsv">Use HSV</string>
    <string name="hint_colourcalc_hsv">Using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) instead of plain RGB (Red, Green, Blue) will result in colours being much more vibrant, but the calculations that are being preformed are more complicated which can result in longer loading times on slower devices.</string>
    <string name="option_dashsearch_full">Advanced search</string>
    <string name="hint_dashsearch_full">Enabling this option will result in better Dash search results but will also affect performance on slower devices or devices with a lot of apps installed. If Dash search is slow for you, you might want to consider disabling this.</string>
    <string name="option_dashsearch_lenses">Use lenses</string>
    <string name="hint_dashsearch_lenses">Lenses provide extra search functionality. Using lenses you can search other services like DuckDuckGo, Stack Overflow, or even your local files, right from the Dash.</string>

    <string name="option_lenses">Search sources</string>
    <string name="hint_lenses">Choose which source searches you want to use and in which order you want their results to appear in the Dash. When you do a search in the Dash, your query is sent to all enabled lenses and their results are shown.</string>

    <string name="title_activity_contribute">How can I contribute?</string>
    <string name="contribute_intro">A lot of time and hard work went into the development of this application. If you\'d like to help out, there are several ways in which you can do so.</string>
    <string name="contribute_translate_title">Translate</string>
    <string name="contribute_translate_description">DistroHopper is available in several languages. This is because volunteers provide the project with their translations. If DistroHopper has not been translated yet into your own language, and you understand English (and you have sufficient knowledge of the Linux desktop to understand some of the more Unity-related terms), then helping out with translations is a good way to help out.
        \nTranslations for DistroHopper are managed on Transifex. All you need to do is request to join a translation team. After that I will approve your request and you are good to go.</string>
    <string name="contribute_translate_go">Go to Transifex</string>
    <string name="contribute_bugs_title">Report bugs</string>
    <string name="contribute_bugs_description">If there is a bug in DistroHopper, that does not necessarily mean that I am aware of its existence. Developers are generally quite bad at testing their own applications as they will only use them in a way they are intended to be used. Some problems also only exist in certain specific circumstances (for example a certain device running a specific version of Android with some extra options enabled). So if you find a bug in DistroHopper (or if you have a feature request) you can help out by reporting it.
        \nBug reports for DistroHopper are kept on GitHub. If GitHub is too technical for you, you can also just send an e-mail to android-dev@robinj.be. Just make sure it\'s in English or Dutch. Please provide as much (relevant) information as possible.</string>
    <string name="contribute_bugs_go">Go to GitHub</string>
    <string name="contribute_donate_title">Donate</string>
    <string name="contribute_donate_description">If you want, you can also make a monetary donation to the developer. Donations are handled via PayPal. You will be able to pick the amount of money you\'d like to donate.
        \nNote: It\'s a donation. I am not selling anything, and you are not buying anything. Donations are greatly appreciated, but you will not gain any additional features because of it. All features of this application are available free of charge.</string>
