  <string name="category_colourcalc">Dominant color calculation</string>
  <string name="option_launchericon_size">Pinned icon size</string>
  <string name="hint_launchericon_size">How large icons for pinned apps should be. The slider goes from 48dip to 120dip, with the default (right in the middle) being 84dip.</string>
  <string name="option_launchericon_opacity">Icon background opacity</string>
  <string name="hint_launchericon_opacity">How opaque the background color of icons in the Launcher should be.</string>
  <string name="hint_launcherservice_enabled">When you swipe from the bottom half of the left edge of the screen, the Launcher will appear, allowing you to launch apps which you have pinned to the Launcher without having to go to the home screen.\n(EXPERIMENTAL)</string>
  <string name="option_launcher_running_show">Show running apps</string>
  <string name="option_panel_show">Show</string>
  <string name="hint_panel_show">Whether the Panel at the top of the screen should be shown or not.</string>
  <string name="option_panel_opacity">Opacity</string>
  <string name="hint_panel_opacity">How opaque the Panel should be.</string>
  <string name="option_unitybackground_dynamic">Dynamic background color</string>
  <string name="hint_unitybackground_dynamic">Dynamically pick the background color of transparent Unity components (Launcher, and the Dash and Panel when the Dash is opened) based on the dominant color of the wallpaper. This won\'t work when a live wallpaper is set, in which case it will fall back to a transparent black.</string>
  <string name="option_unitybackground_colour">Background color</string>
  <string name="hint_unitybackground_colour">The background color that should be used for transparent Unity components.</string>
  <string name="message_unitybackground_colour">Use the sliders to pick a color.</string>

  <string name="option_unitywallpaper_blur">Wallpaper blur method</string>
  <string name="hint_unitywallpaper_blur">The method that should be used to blur the background when the Dash is opened. When \"Downscale &amp; upscale\" is chosen and it fails (or a live wallpaper is set), \"Darken\" will be used as fallback.</string>
  <string name="option_launcher_edge">Screen edge</string>
  <string name="hint_launcher_edge">To which screen edge the Launcher should be attached.</string>

  <string name="option_wallpaper">Wallpaper</string>
  <string name="hint_wallpaper">Change wallpaper</string>
  <string name="option_colourcalc_advanced">Take more samples</string>
  <string name="hint_colourscalc_advanced">Taking more samples greatly increases accuracy but can result in longer loading times on slower devices.</string>
  <string name="option_colourcalc_hsv">Use HSV</string>
  <string name="hint_colourcalc_hsv">Using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) instead of plain RGB (Red, Green, Blue) will result in colors being much more vibrant, but the calculations that are being preformed are more complicated which can result in longer loading times on slower devices.</string>
  <string name="option_dashsearch_full">Advanced search</string>
  <string name="hint_dashsearch_full">Enabling this option will result in better Dash search results but will also affect performance on slower devices or devices with a lot of apps installed. If Dash search is slow for you, you might want to consider disabling this.</string>
  <string name="option_dashsearch_lenses">Use lenses</string>
  <string name="hint_dashsearch_lenses">Lenses provide extra search functionality. Using lenses you can search other services like DuckDuckGo, Stack Overflow, or even your local files, right from the Dash.</string>
  <string name="option_dashsearch_lenses_maxresults">Results per lens</string>
  <string name="hint_dashsearch_lenses_maxresults">The maximum number of search results that is shown from each lens.</string>
  <string name="option_dash_ready_show">Open Dash by default</string>
  <string name="hint_dash_ready_show">The Dash will automatically be opened once apps are loaded.</string>

  <string name="title_activity_contribute">How can I contribute?</string>
  <string name="contribute_intro">A lot of time and hard work went into the development of this application. If you\'d like to help out, there are several ways in which you can do so.</string>
  <string name="contribute_translate_go">Go to Transifex</string>
  <string name="contribute_bugs_title">Report bugs</string>
  <string name="contribute_bugs_go">Go to GitHub</string>
  <string name="contribute_donate_title">Donate</string>
  <string name="contribute_donate_description">If you want, you can also make a monetary donation to the developer. Donations are handled via PayPal. You will be able to pick the amount of money you\'d like to donate.
        \nNote: It\'s a donation. I am not selling anything, and you are not buying anything. Donations are greatly appreciated, but you will not gain any additional features because of it. All features of this application are available free of charge.
        \n
        \nPayPal takes a $0.30 + 2.2\%% fee, so if your donation is less than $0.30 then all of it will go to PayPal, and none of it will reach the developer. If you donate, it\'s best to make your donation more than this amount, unless for some strange reason you\'d like to make a donation to PayPal itself.</string>
